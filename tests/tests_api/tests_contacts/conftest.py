    Create a contact for a test and ensure teardown deletes it.

      - If creation fails, the fixture will `pytest.skip()` the test (so dependent tests are skipped rather than failing with setup noise).
      - On teardown it attempts to DELETE the created contact; if deletion fails it logs a warning but does not swallow a preceding test failure.
